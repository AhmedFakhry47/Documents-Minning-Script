#  Documents Minning Script
R script used to automate the process of extracting useful information from several text sources and combine what it found in these sources in a single pdf.

It workes well if you know how to use regex but it also works fine if you just hit a sentence and let the script do its work.

**Requirements to run the script** <br />
1- R  <br /> 
2- pdftools library  <br /> 
3- grid & gridExtra library  <br />
