R script used to automate the process of extracting useful information from several text sources and combine what it found in these sources in a single pdf.

It workes well if you know how to use regex but it also works fine if you just hit a sentence and let the script do its work.

#Requirements to run the script 
1- R
2- pdftools library
3- grid & gridExtra library 

All installed.
